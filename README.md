# Lafayette_Workshop_11-2-18

The materials in this repo are from a Compute-to-Learn Workshop at Lafayette College given by Dr. Heidi Hendrickson, a chemistry professor at Lafayette College, and Ellen Mulvihill, a chemistry graduate student at University of Michigan. The workshop was designed to be an introduction to the Compute-to-Learn pedagogy along with describing how it was first implemented at Michigan, an R1 institution, and then adapted to Lafayette, a Primarily Undergraduate Institution. The workshop was open to faculty from all fields, as the C2L pedadgogy can be adapted easily to fields outside of chemistry. 

### Workshop Objectives: 
Participants will:
- Learn the basics of the Wolfram programming language
- Program a demonstration in Mathematica
- Develop ideas for demonstrations related to topics in their own courses
- Learn about differences in implementing C2L at various institution types
- Identify challenges and discuss strategies for implementing C2L in their own courses
